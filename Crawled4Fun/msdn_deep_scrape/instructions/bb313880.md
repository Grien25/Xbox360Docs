COLLECTED BY
[Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/webwidecrawl)
[Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web/web.php). 
Collection: [Live Web Proxy Crawls](https://archive.org/details/liveweb)
[Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web/web.php) Live Proxy mostly by the Save Page Now feature on web.archive.org.   
  
Liveweb proxy is a component of Internet Archive’s wayback machine project. The liveweb proxy captures the content of a web page in real time, archives it into a ARC or WARC file and returns the ARC/WARC record back to the wayback machine to process. The recorded ARC/WARC file becomes part of the wayback machine in due course of time.
