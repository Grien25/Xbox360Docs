vfetch (xvs_3_0, xps_3_0)
Fetches data from a vertex buffer using a semantic.  ```
vfetch dest, src1, Semantic [, name = value, ...]
```
  
---  
# Name-Value Pair 

**RoundIndex** = **bool** 
    If **RoundIndex** is **true** , the _src1_ index value is rounded to the nearest integer; otherwise, the _src1_ index value is floored. The default value is **false**. 

**ExpAdjust** = **int** 
    Data multiplier. This value must be an integer between −32 and 31. The fetched vertex data is multiplied by two raised to the **ExpAdjust** value. The default value is 0 (the data is multiplied by one—no change). 

**UseTextureCache** = **bool** 
    If **UseTextureCache** is **true** , the **vfetch (xvs_3_0, xps_3_0)** instruction caches its data in the texture cache; otherwise, the instruction caches its data in the vertex cachce. The default value is **false**.
