XNA Game Studio 3.1
Microcode (xvs_3_0, xps_3_0)
This section describes inline microcode shaders for Xbox 360. These shaders may be written in as inline microcode and compiled with the XNA Framework Content Pipeline. 
Microcode assembly language is the native shader assembly language of Xbox 360. It is a different language than the DX token assembly language used by Direct3D for Microsoft Windows.
You can write inline microcode assembly within an HLSL shader using the **asm** directive.
Microcode assembly language supports a superset of the ps_3_0 and vs_3_0 specifications defined by Direct3D 9.0 for Windows. It does not support earlier Direct3D vertex and pixel shader specifications. The microcode assembly vertex shader specification is defined as xvs_3_0, while the microcode assembly pixel shader specification is defined as xps_3_0.

## Inline Microcode Assembly in HLSL

**Source:** http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb313871.aspx
**Word Count:** 397

XNA Game Studio 3.1
Inline Microcode Assembly in HLSL
The **asm** keyword allows Xbox 360 GPU microcode to be inserted (inline) into HLSL functions, as shown here. 
```
float4 FetchPosition( int i )
{
  float4 vertexPos;
  asm {
    vfetch vertexPos, i, position
  };
  return vertexPos;
}  
```

The inline microcode starts with **asm{** , followed by one or more microcode statements. It ends with **};**. The trailing semicolon at the end of the microcode block is always required.
The **asm** block does not contain a target such as **xvs_3_0** or **xps_3_0**. This allows the same routine to be called from both vertex shaders and pixel shaders. On Xbox 360, the **asm** block supports only [Xbox 360 microcode](https://web.archive.org/web/20100423055133/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb313877.aspx).
# Sequencer Statements
  * No control flow statements are allowed. Instead, use one or more **asm** blocks with HLSL control flow.
```
for ( int i = 0; i < 2; i++ )
{
  asm {
  // one or more microcode statements
  };
};        
```



# Registers and Variables
  * The microcode must use HLSL local or global variable names. The **asm** microcode block cannot use any registers.
  * Only simple HLSL variables are allowed within the microcodeâ€”no structures or arrays. These variables can be swizzled.
  * HLSL variables can be used as the "value" part of a name-value pair in addition to being used as source and destination arguments.
```
float4 fetchS( sampler2D s, float2 uv, float offsetX )
{
  float4 result;
  asm {
    tfetch2D result, uv, s, OffsetX = offsetX
  };
  return result;
}        
```



# HLSL Variable Binding in Microcode
If a symbol is used as a microcode source, destination, or value argument, the symbol's meaning is determined as follows.
  1. If the symbol is a variable in the lexically enclosed HLSL environment, then that variable is used.
  2. If the symbol appears as a "value" argument, and the symbol matches one of the existing GPU microcode enumerated types, then that enumerated value is used.

## Vertex Fetching in HLSL (xvs_3_0, xps_3_0)

**Source:** http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb313874.aspx
**Word Count:** 268

XNA Game Studio 3.1
Vertex Fetching in HLSL (xvs_3_0, xps_3_0)
Vertex fetching in HLSL is implemented by using a combination of the INDEX input semantic and an **asm** block that uses a [vfetch](https://web.archive.org/web/20100423061946/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb313960.aspx) instruction. 
The following HLSL code shows how vertex fetching can be used to implement an alternative to [SetFrequency](https://web.archive.org/web/20100423061946/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.xna.framework.graphics.vertexstream.setfrequency.aspx). Note that the INDEX input semantic is associated with a parameter of type **int**. 
```
    float instanceSize : register( c0 ); // Set by application code.
    
    struct vsout {
      float4 p : POSITION;
      float4 c : COLOR;
    };
    
    float4 fetchPosition( int index )
    {
      float4 pos;
      asm {
        vfetch pos, index, position
      };
      return pos;
    }
    
    float4 fetchDelta( int index )
    {
      float4 pos;
      asm {
        vfetch pos, index, position1
      };
      return pos;
    }

    float4 fetchColor( int index )
    {
      float4 color;
      asm {
        vfetch color, index, color
      };
      return color;
    }
    
    vsout main( int i : INDEX )
    {
      vsout output;
      
      // Add 0.5 before dividing to avoid rounding errors.
      int outerIndex = (i + 0.5) / instanceSize;
      
      int innerIndex = i - outerIndex * instanceSize;
      output.p = fetchPosition( innerIndex ) + fetchDelta( outerIndex );
      output.c = fetchColor( outerIndex );
      return output;
    }
  
```

## Texture Fetching in HLSL (xvs_3_0, xps_3_0)

**Source:** http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb313873.aspx
**Word Count:** 248

XNA Game Studio 3.1
Texture Fetching in HLSL (xvs_3_0, xps_3_0)
Inline microcode assembly can be used to access the [extra parameters](https://web.archive.org/web/20100423063105/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb313958.aspx) that are available when fetching texures. This is useful primarily for the **OffsetX** , **OffsetY** , and **OffsetZ** parameters. 
The following code demonstrates texture fetching in HLSL.
```
    struct vsout {
      float4 p : POSITION;
      float4 uv : TEXCOORD;
    };
    
    struct psin {
      float4 uv : TEXCOORD;
    };
    
    vsout TFetchVS( vsout input )
    {
      return input;
    }
    
    sampler2D s : register( s0 );
    
    float4 tex2DOffset( sampler2D ss, float2 uv, float2 offset )
    {
      float4 result;
      float offsetX = offset.x;
      float offsetY = offset.y;
     
      asm {
        tfetch2D result, uv, ss, OffsetX = offsetX,
        OffsetY = offsetY
      };
      
      return result;
    }

    float4 TFetchPS( psin input ) : COLOR
    {
      float4 sum = 0;
     
      for( int i = 0; i < 3; i++ )
      {
        for( int j = 0; j < 3; j++ )
        {
          sum += tex2DOffset( s, input.uv, float2( i - 1, j - 1 ) );
        }
      }
      
      return sum / 9.0;
    }
  
```

## Swizzling (xvs_3_0, xps_3_0)

**Source:** http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb313962.aspx
**Word Count:** 784

XNA Game Studio 3.1
Swizzling (xvs_3_0, xps_3_0)
Swizzling is a way of specifying which inputs go to what channels and only applies to input registers. There are four different types of swizzling, based on the instruction type.
  * [vfetch Instructions](https://web.archive.org/web/20100429090724/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb313962.aspx#vfetch)
  * [tfetch Instructions](https://web.archive.org/web/20100429090724/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb313962.aspx#tfetch)
  * [Vector ALU Instructions](https://web.archive.org/web/20100429090724/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb313962.aspx#vector)
  * [Scalar ALU Instructions](https://web.archive.org/web/20100429090724/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb313962.aspx#scalar)


# vfetch Instructions
The one-component swizzle for **vfetch** instructions is always of the following form.
```
_src_.{x|y|z|w}
```

# tfetch Instructions
There are four **tfetch** instructions. The swizzling for these instructions is used to indicate the components of the source register to use for the texture lookup. Each instruction is of the following form.
```
tfetch _dest_, _src_, _fetchConst_
```

## tfetch1D
The [tfetch1D](https://web.archive.org/web/20100429090724/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb313956.aspx) instruction performs a 1D texture lookup. The _src_ register must have a one-component swizzle. For example, _src_ might be r4.x. The swizzle (".x" in this case) indicates that the texture coordinate comes from the x-component of the r4 register.
The one-component swizzle for the [tfetch1D](https://web.archive.org/web/20100429090724/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb313956.aspx) instruction is always of the following form.
```
_src_.{x|y|z|w}
```

## tfetch2D
The [tfetch2D](https://web.archive.org/web/20100429090724/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb313957.aspx) instruction performs a 2D texture lookup. The _src_ register must have a two-component swizzle. For example, _src_ might be r4.wx. The swizzle (".wx" in this case) indicates that the w- and x-components are used to lookup the U and V texture coordinates, respectively.
The two-component swizzle for the [tfetch2D](https://web.archive.org/web/20100429090724/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb313957.aspx) instruction is always of the following form.
```
_src_.{x|y|z|w}{x|y|z|w}
```

## tfetch3D and tfetchCube
The [tfetch3D](https://web.archive.org/web/20100429090724/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb313958.aspx) instruction performs a 3D texture lookup. The [tfetchCube](https://web.archive.org/web/20100429090724/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb313959.aspx) instruction performs a cube texture lookup. The _src_ register must have a three-component swizzle. For example, _src_ might be r4.wxz. The swizzle (".wxz" in this case) indicates that the w-, x- and z-components are used to lookup the u, v and w texture coordinates, respectively.
The three-component swizzle for these two instructions is always of the following form.
```
_src_.{x|y|z|w}{x|y|z|w}{x|y|z|w}
```

# Vector ALU Instructions
Every [vector ALU instruction](https://web.archive.org/web/20100429090724/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb313916.aspx) may make use of an optional four-component swizzle. This swizzle allows individual components of the source register to temporarily take on the value of any of the four components of the same register, before that register is read for computation. The contents of the source register are not modified by the swizzle.
The four-component swizzle for the vector ALU instructions is always of the following form.
```
_src_[.{x|y|z|w}[x|y|z|w][x|y|z|w][x|y|z|w]]
```

The first optional block specifies the x-component, the second optional block specifies the y-component, and so on. For example, the .zxxy swizzle means:
  * The x-component will temporarily take on the value of the z-component.
  * The y-component will temporarily take on the value of the x-component.
  * The z-component will temporarily take on the value of the x-component.
  * The w-component will temporarily take on the value of the y-component.


Components can appear in any order. If fewer than four components are specified, the last component is repeated. For example, .xy is the same as .xyyy, .wzx is the same as .wzxx, and .z is the same as .zzzz. If no components are specified, no swizzling occurs. No swizzling is the same as .xyzw.
# Scalar ALU Instructions
Every [scalar ALU instruction](https://web.archive.org/web/20100429090724/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb313879.aspx) requires either a one- or two-component swizzle that indicates the components to use for the scalar operation. Almost all scalar ALU instructions operate on a single component of the source register. These scalar instructions make use of a one-component swizzle. Consider the following example.
```
cos r4, r3.y
```

The ".y" swizzle on the source register tells the scalar instruction to use compute the cosine of the y-component of r3.
The one-component swizzle for the scalar ALU instructions is always of the following form.
```
_src_.{x|y|z|w}
```

There are six scalar ALU instructions that operate on two components of their source register.

  * [subs](https://web.archive.org/web/20100429090724/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb313913.aspx)


These six instructions require a two-component swizzle that indicates the components to use. Consider the following example.
```
subs r4, r3.zx
```

The ".zx" swizzle on the source register tells the scalar instruction to compute the difference of r3.z and r3.x.
The two-component swizzle for the scalar ALU instructions is always of the following form.
```
_src_.{x|y|z|w}{x|y|z|w}
```

The first mandatory component indicates the first operand for the instruction. The second mandatory component indicates the second operand for the instruction.

XNA Game Studio 3.1
vfetch (xvs_3_0, xps_3_0)
Fetches data from a vertex buffer using a semantic.  ```
vfetch dest, src1, Semantic [, name = value, ...]
```
  
---  
# Name-Value Pair 

**RoundIndex** = **bool** 
    If **RoundIndex** is **true** , the _src1_ index value is rounded to the nearest integer; otherwise, the _src1_ index value is floored. The default value is **false**. 

**ExpAdjust** = **int** 
    Data multiplier. This value must be an integer between âˆ’32 and 31. The fetched vertex data is multiplied by two raised to the **ExpAdjust** value. The default value is 0 (the data is multiplied by oneâ€”no change). 

**UseTextureCache** = **bool** 
    If **UseTextureCache** is **true** , the **vfetch (xvs_3_0, xps_3_0)** instruction caches its data in the texture cache; otherwise, the instruction caches its data in the vertex cachce. The default value is **false**.

```
  
---  
# Name-Value Pair 

**UnnormalizedTextureCoords** = **bool** 
    If **UnnormalizedTextureCoords** is **true** , texture coordinates should range between 0 and the dimensions of the texture; otherwise, the texture coordinates should range beween 0.0f and 1.0f. The default value is **false**. 

**MagFilter** = **enum** 
    
Filter used when the texture is magnified. **MagFilter** must be one of the following values.
Value | Description

point | Point filter. The texel with coordinates nearest to the desired pixel value is used.  
linear | Bilinear interpolation filter. A weighted average of a 22 area of texels surrounding the desired pixel is used.  
keep | Use the filtering set up by Direct3D. This is the default value. 

**MinFilter** = **enum**

---|---  
point | Point filter. The mipmap with coordinates nearest to the desired pixel value is used.  
linear | Trilinear interpolation filtering is used as a mipmap filter, using the texels of the two nearest mipmap textures.  
keep | Use the filtering set up by Direct3D. This is the default value. 

**AnisoFilter** = **enum** 
      
Anisotropic filter used for minification and magnification. **AnisoFilter** must be one of the following values.
Value | Description  
---|---  
disabled | No anisotropic filtering.  
max1to1 | Use at most 1 sample for anisotropic filtering.  
max2to1 | Use at most 2 samples for anisotropic filtering.  
max4to1 | Use at most 4 samples for anisotropic filtering.  
max8to1 | Use at most 8 samples for anisotropic filtering.  
max16to1 | Use at most 16 samples for anisotropic filtering.  
keep | Use the anisotropic filtering as set up by Direct3D. This is the default value. 

**UseComputedLOD** = **bool** 
    If **UseComputedLOD** is **true** , the shader will use the LOD computed in the texture pipeline. The default value is **true**. For more details, see [Computing the LOD](https://web.archive.org/web/20090511231340/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb313956.aspx). 

**UseRegisterLOD** = **bool** 
    If **UseRegisterLOD** is **true** , the shader will use the LOD set by [setTexLOD](https://web.archive.org/web/20090511231340/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb313955.aspx). The default value is **false**. For more details, see [Computing the LOD](https://web.archive.org/web/20090511231340/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb313956.aspx). 

**LODBias** = **float** 
    Bias to add to the LOD. The _value_ must be a number between âˆ’4.0 and 3.9375. In addition, _value_ must be an integer multiple of 0.0625. The default value is 0.0f. For more details, see [Computing the LOD](https://web.archive.org/web/20090511231340/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb313956.aspx). 

**OffsetX** = **float** 
    Value added to the x-component of the texel address right before sampling. The _value_ must be between âˆ’8.0f and 7.5f. In addition, _value_ must be an integer multiple of 0.5f. The default value is 0.0f. 

**OffsetY** = **float** 
    Value added to the y-component of the texel address right before sampling. The _value_ must be between âˆ’8.0f and 7.5f. In addition, _value_ must be an integer multiple of 0.5f. The default value is 0.0f. 

**OffsetZ** = **float** 
    Value added to the z-component of the texel address right before sampling. The _value_ must be between âˆ’8.0f and 7.5f. In addition, _value_ must be an integer multiple of 0.5f. The default value is 0.0f. 

**FetchValidOnly** = **bool** 
      
Performance booster that determines if pixel data should be fetched for pixels outside of the current primitive. The default value is **true**. For vertex shaders, **FetchValidOnly** should always be **true**. For pixel shaders, **FetchValidOnly** should be **true** , unless the result of the **tfetch** instruction is used to calculate a gradient, by using [getGradients](https://web.archive.org/web/20090511231340/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb464129.aspx) or a **tfetch** instruction with **UseComputedLOD** set to **true**. 
Gradient information is calculated by running a 2Ã—2 quad of pixel shaders and computing the difference between the resulting pixels. At the edges of triangles, there are situations where one or more of the pixel shaders in the quad lies outside the boundary of the triangle, and so its computed values won't be output. The **FetchValidOnly** value is used to tell the hardware that it doesn't have to fetch the pixel data for these out-of-bounds pixel shaders. When **FetchValidOnly** is **true** , data will be fetched only for those pixels that are valid (inside the triangle), which speeds up the calculations.
In cases where the result of the texture fetch is itself used to calculate gradient information, all four pixel shaders in the quad are necessary to compute the gradients, and **FetchValidOnly** should be set to **false**.
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20090511231340im_/http://i.msdn.microsoft.com/Global/Images/clear.gif) Remarks 
The _src1_ register specifies the coordinates from which to fetch the sample data.
If **UnnormalizedTextureCoords** is **true** , you must set the [AddressU](https://web.archive.org/web/20090511231340/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.xna.framework.graphics.samplerstate.addressu.aspx) texture sampler state to a clamping mode such as [TextureAddressMode.Clamp](https://web.archive.org/web/20090511231340/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.xna.framework.graphics.textureaddressmode.aspx), rather than a wrapping mode. Using a wrapping mode will force normalized texture coordinates even if **UnnormalizedTextureCoords** is **true**.
To access access 1D textures that are wider than 8192 texels, you must use unnormalized texture coordinates.

---  
To use the **tfetch1D (xvs_3_0, xps_3_0)** instruction in a vertex shader, **UseComputedLOD** must be **false** unless you manually set the gradients and set **UseRegisterGradients** to **true**.  
## Computing the LOD
The total LOD for a sample is additive and is based on what is enabled. The total LOD is determined by the LOD computed in the texture pipeline (if **UseComputedLOD** is **true**), the LOD set by [setTexLOD](https://web.archive.org/web/20090511231340/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb313955.aspx) (if **UseRegisterLOD** is **true**), and the **LODBias** value.

## Computing the LOD
The total LOD for a sample is additive and is based on what is enabled. The total LOD is determined by the LOD computed in the texture pipeline (if **UseComputedLOD** is **true**), the LOD set by [setTexLOD](https://web.archive.org/web/20100425013737/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb313955.aspx) (if **UseRegisterLOD** is **true**), and the **LODBias** value.

COLLECTED BY
[Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/webwidecrawl)
[Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web/web.php). 
Collection: [Live Web Proxy Crawls](https://archive.org/details/liveweb)
[Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web/web.php) Live Proxy mostly by the Save Page Now feature on web.archive.org.   
  
Liveweb proxy is a component of Internet Archiveâ€™s wayback machine project. The liveweb proxy captures the content of a web page in real time, archives it into a ARC or WARC file and returns the ARC/WARC record back to the wayback machine to process. The recorded ARC/WARC file becomes part of the wayback machine in due course of time.
