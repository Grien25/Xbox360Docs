Microcode (xvs_3_0, xps_3_0)
This section describes inline microcode shaders for Xbox 360. These shaders may be written in as inline microcode and compiled with the XNA Framework Content Pipeline. 
Microcode assembly language is the native shader assembly language of Xbox 360. It is a different language than the DX token assembly language used by Direct3D for Microsoft Windows.
You can write inline microcode assembly within an HLSL shader using the **asm** directive.
Microcode assembly language supports a superset of the ps_3_0 and vs_3_0 specifications defined by Direct3D 9.0 for Windows. It does not support earlier Direct3D vertex and pixel shader specifications. The microcode assembly vertex shader specification is defined as xvs_3_0, while the microcode assembly pixel shader specification is defined as xps_3_0.
